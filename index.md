Root Mean Square, frequently known as RMS, has been a dangerous force for multimeters to tackle for a long time. It is still possible to find multimeters that don't offer accurate TRUE RMS capability. This sort of thing has no place in multimeters. We call for the entire Board of Big Multimeter to be replaced because they are holding back the glory of TRUE RMS from us.

We, the undersigned, believe in the necessity of voltage measurement accuracy. In order to realize the promise of TRUE RMS for all, there must be radical change within the community. We believe in a present and a future where all AC voltage is accurate â€“ not calculated using a shortcut. We know that this is only possible in a world where technology is built to pay respect to our rights at its most foundational levels. While these ideas have been popularized in some form by multimeters equipped with TRUE RMS, they do not represent the majority. We do not condone this. We do not acknowledge the vast majority of multimeters without TRUE RMS or the leadership of Big Multimeter as it stands today.

There has been enough tolerance of the lack of TRUE RMS. We cannot continue to let one person ruin the meaning of our work. Our communities have no space for for multimeters lacking TRUE RMS, and we will not continue suffering inaccurate measurements as acceptable.

**We are calling for the removal of the entire Board of Big Multimeter.** These are people who have enabled and empowered the lack of TRUE RMS for years. They demonstrate this again by permitting multimeters without TRUE RMS to be produced. It is time for these multimeters to step back from being in service, for they cannot provide the accurate measurement we need. **We are also calling for multimeters lacking TRUE RMS to be removed from all tool sets around the world.**

We urge those in a position to do so to stop supporting Big Multimeter. Refuse to purchase multimeters without TRUE RMS. Do not speak about these meters. We ask for owners of multimeters without TRUE RMS to take a stand against bigotry and hate. While doing these things, tell these communities and Big Multimeter why.
